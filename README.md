# Travis CI with Snapcraft 

This base builds includes: 

* Cron Jobs
* Package fetching
* Setting up a good fundation for your project 
* Just to see how verbose I could get this
* LXD Containers
* Enviornment Variables

Using Snapcraft with Travis CI to demonstrate LXD using a LXD daemon which is an operating-system-level virtualization method. This pulls media software (VLC, Skype) and gets info on the programs all whilst using LXD and spinning up on a Travis CI build.
